    "# Exploring Random Forest and Fidex rule generation for obesity risk classification\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to HES-Xplain, our interactive platform designed to facilitate explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques. In this use case, we dive into obesity risk classification and showcase another application example of explainability techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is an alternative to the [`Exploring Dimlp and Fidex rule generation for breast cancer classification`](TODO). It aims to be similar but aims to use a different dataset and training model to show the versatility of our explainability tools.  In addition, we will cover how to pre-process a dataset that is not initially usable by a model and convert it to an exploitable dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Observe a different use case where XAI can be used.\n",
    "    2. Understand how to pre-process data.\n",
    "    3. Understand how to use Dimlp and Fidex.\n",
    "    4. Showcase the versatility of HES-Xplain using a different dataset and training model.\n",
    "    5. Provide practical insights into applying Random Forests and Fidex to breast cancer classifiers through an interactive notebook.\n",
    "    6. Foster a community of XAI enthusiasts and practitioners.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outline:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Dataset and Problem Statement.\n",
    "    2. Load and pre-process the dataset.\n",
    "    3. Train the Model.\n",
    "    4. Local rules generation - Fidex.\n",
    "    5. Global ruleSet generation - FidexGlo.\n",
    "    6. Conclusion.\n",
    "    7. References.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this use case, we aim to show the users the potential of Random Forests and Fidex as tools for transparent and interpretable classification. With HES-Xplain, we make XAI accessible, helping users build trust in their models and make informed decisions."

    "In this notebook, we explored explainable AI using Random Forests and the Fidex family of algorithms. We prepared our dataset, trained a Random Forest model, and examined the generated rules. We used `Fidex` to create local rules for individual sample explanations and `FidexGloRules` to generate a global ruleset for the entire training dataset. Finally, we evaluated the ruleset with `FidexGloStats`, providing insights into the model's accuracy, fidelity, and explainability.\n",

    "This process demonstrated how explainable AI techniques can clarify complex models, making them more transparent and trustworthy. By understanding our model's decision-making process, we can ensure better, more reliable outcomes in various applications. Using Random Forests with Fidex offers a balanced approach to building interpretable and effective AI models."
